 * [BETA]
 * The base class for context objects for client-side components.
 *
 * @remarks
 * A "context" object is a collection of well-known services and other
 * objects that are likely to be needed by any business logic working with
 * the associated component.  Each component type has its own specialized subclass
 * ofClientSideComponentContext, e.g. WebPartContext for web parts,
 * ExtensionContext for client-side extensions, etc.
 *
 * The constructor for this class is marked as internal; third party code should not inherit
 * directly from this base class.
 *
 * @internalremarks
 *
 * NOTE: The context object is a convenience that avoids the overhead of
 * properly factoring the dependencies for each class in your project,
 * in a situation where many classes have essentially the same dependencies.
 * If lots of members are added to the context without displine, it can
 * easily devolve into a poor engineering practice (where "everything depends
 * on everything else").  Think carefully before adding more objects to this
 * interface.
 *
 * Only add data properties or well-defined classes with ubiquitous applicability.
 * Do not add loose functions, callbacks, or settable properties to this class.
 *
